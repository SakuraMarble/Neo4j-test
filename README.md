# Neo4j Algorithm Time Cost Tests:Page-Rank,Dijkstra-Single-Source,Wcc and Label-Propagation

## How to Run

Just enter in the terminal:
```bash
./bash.sh
```

Then it will run main.py 20 times.

And you will get the results of these algorithms on the graph database in files **result_%s** and the average time of each algorithm in the file **result_final.csv**
